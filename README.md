**Caesar Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor**

**Overview**
A simple Python program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. This project was developed as part of an internship to demonstrate basic encryption principles.

**Features**
- Encrypt or decrypt messages with a user-defined shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation).
- Input validation for shift values.

**How to Run**
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

**Clone the project and navigate to the directory:**

- git clone (https://github.com/vatsalsapovadiya/PRODIGY_CS_TASK-1)
- cd Caesar_Cipher

**Run the program:**
- python main.py

**Security Considerations:**
- The Caesar Cipher is not secure for modern applications due to its simple shifting mechanism.
- Suitable for educational purposes or simple encoding, not for securing sensitive data.
